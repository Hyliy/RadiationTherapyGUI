# RadiationTherapyGUI

This is a user interface designed to collect data for pair-wise comparisons between the DVHs of radiotherapy plans.

The same user interface can be used to train radiotherapy planners in a interactive manner.

While the current version is working OK, we are in the process of refining it.



This implementation requires the following packages:

1. Pandas
2. Plotly
3. PyQt5

Python Version: 3.7 or later
