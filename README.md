# User interface for generating radiotherapy pairwise comparison data and gamified training on radiotherapy guidelines.

This is a user interfac eunder development by Hung Yi Lee, Hongcheng Liu, and Bo Lu.  The purpose is to collect data for pair-wise comparisons between the DVHs of radiotherapy plans. The same user interface can be used to train radiotherapy planners in an interactive manner. 

Though still under development, the codes should be able to support the main functions successfully.

If you would like to see examples of interactive display of DVH curves for plan comparisons without actually running the complete code for the GUI, you can find them in the folder "Examples". Please download them and open as a webbrowser. This display allows a user to zoom in/out and display/hide each DVH curve easily. These examples are generated by the GUI when two plans are selected by an operator for comparison.



To run the entire GUI requires the following packages:

1. Pandas
2. Plotly
3. PyQt5

Python Version: 3.7 or later
