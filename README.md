# RadiationTherapyGUI

This is a user interface designed to collect data for pair-wise comparisons between the DVHs of radiotherapy plans.

The same user interface can be used to train radiotherapy planners in an interactive manner.

While the current version is working OK, we are in the process of refining it.

If you would like to see examples of interactive display of DVH curves for plan comparisons without actually running the complete code for the GUI, you can find them in the folder "Examples". This display allows a user to zoom in/out and display/hide each DVH curve easily. These examples are generated by the GUI when two plans are selected by an operator for comparison.



To run the entire GUI requires the following packages:

1. Pandas
2. Plotly
3. PyQt5

Python Version: 3.7 or later
